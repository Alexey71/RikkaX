    Please try:
    <br>1. Remove \"old\" devices from <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity">Recently used devices</a> (if this device is recognized as a \"new\" device)
    <br>2. Clear the data of Play Store
    <br>3. Make sure app is installed from Google Play <b>with the account you purchased</b>
    <br>4. Remove your Google account in system settings and add again
    <br><b>After any attempt, remember to force stop related apps (even reboot the device)</b>
    <br><br>* This issue is caused by Google Play\â€™s inability to provide proof of purchase. This \"owned\" status does not include the proof of purchase which can be verified, so we cannot conclude that you have purchased, or the purchase will be easily to fake.
