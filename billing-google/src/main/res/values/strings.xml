    <string name="dialog_billing_already_owned_message">This is because the Play Store does not provide the correct purchase information (lack of critical credentials). Other apps involving purchases should also be anomalous when this issue occurs.\n\nThis problem is not our fault and cannot be solved by us.\n\nThe following methods may solve the problem: \n1. Clear the data of Play Store.\n2. If you have logged in to multiple Google accounts, reinstall with the account you purchased.\n3. Check the network (especially when you are in mainland China).\n4. Remove your Google account in system settings and add again\n5. Search if this is a bug of a specific version of Play Store.\n\nAfter any attempt, remember to force stop related apps (even reboot the device).</string>
    <string name="dialog_billing_api_action_error_title">Error when interacting with Play Store</string>
    <string name="dialog_billing_api_action_error_message">There may be a variety of reasons, but we know some of the possible reasons that usually limit the permissions of the Play Store. For example, the MIUI China version needs to ensure that the Play Store\'s "display interface in the backgroundâ€œ permission is granted. Please check if there is a similar situation.</string>
    <string name="dialog_billing_unavailable_title">Billing API unavailable</string>
    <string name="dialog_billing_unavailable_message">There are several possibilities: \n1. Play Store is not installed correctly.\n2. The account area does not support purchase (such as the mainland China region).\n3. The connection between the app and the Play Store is blocked (such as the background limit feature).\n4. Use cheating apps like "Lucky Patcher".</string>
